# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Introduction

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with generative AI models. It allows language models to access and utilize external documents or knowledge bases to provide more accurate, contextual, and up-to-date responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, relevant documents or passages are retrieved from a knowledge base using semantic search or keyword matching.

2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is combined with the user's query to create an augmented prompt.

3. **Generation**: A language model generates a response based on both the original query and the retrieved context.

## Key Benefits

- **Accuracy**: Grounds responses in actual documents rather than relying solely on training data
- **Currency**: Can incorporate recent information not present in the model's training data
- **Transparency**: Provides citations and references to source documents
- **Reduced Hallucination**: Decreases the likelihood of generating false or misleading information

## Common Use Cases

- Question-answering over corporate documents
- Customer support automation
- Research and knowledge discovery
- Legal and compliance document analysis
- Technical documentation search
